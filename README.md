Welcome to Dungeons 'N' Data! This application will help you (as a player or dungeon master) track your characters, campaigns, and more! 

**A note about using the Google Sign In option:**

  *Until I get this hosted somewhere, this feature will be out of commission. It requires a User Client ID and a Secret ID from Google that I can't 
  provide in this repository for security reasons. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but setting up a profile is easy to do!*
  
To get started, all you need to do is go to your dungeons_n_data file in your terminal and type 'bundle' + Enter to check the dependencies.

After that's finished, type 'rails s' to run the server. 

When the server is running in your terminal, go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and you should see the app and be able to use it!

Thanks for checking this out! It was fun to make. Please email me at nathan@nathan-stamand.com if you have issues and I'll fix them ASAP!
